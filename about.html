                <p>
                  My name is Nathan Hohensee. I am a junior studying management information systems (MIS) at the University of
                  Nebraska at Omaha. I am originally from Sutton, NE which is a small town about 2 hours southwest of Omaha. I
                  currently work as an IT Intern at The Interpublic Group of Companies. In my free time I like to spend time with
                  friends and family. I also enjoy playing sports like basketball, golf, and flag football.
