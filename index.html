                <p>
                  I am looking forward to this class because we are going to be using languages that I do not have much experience in.
                  I have not really used HTML and CSS since the first semester of my freshman year here at UNO, so I think it is good 
                  that I am going to be refreshing my knowledge in these languages. Python I have used more recently, but I did not learn
                  as much as I would have liked to. I hope to be comfortable using all of these languages in order to create web applications
                  by the end of the semester.
                </p>
